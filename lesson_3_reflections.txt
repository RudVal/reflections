When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
   If i want collaborating with other people and if i want to share my code with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Because Git don't knows when my code isn't broken.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub.
    Clone is a copy of a repository to anywhere.
    Branches are for new changes in the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can work  without access  remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    For example using a shared folder.
    But it is very difficult to work on the same part of the file
   and we have no history of changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   Using branch is better if you work alone or with one or two other people.
